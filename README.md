##  About Me

Hi! I'm Faith Rose Kendi Maitethia, an economist with a strong interest in solving real-world problems using technology. I'm currently exploring software engineering, particularly the intersection of data, automation, and web development.

With a foundation in economics and accounting, I bring analytical thinking, problem-solving skills, and curiosity into every line of code I write. This portfolio reflects my journey of learning, experimenting, and building.
